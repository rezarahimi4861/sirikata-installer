These is the installer configuration and scripts for Sirikata. See
Sirikata's home page at http://sirikata.com for details on the
project. Here we have the installer project for BitRock InstallBuilder
and some helper scripts.

The sirikata.xml InstallBuilder project has the majority of the
configuration. To create installers for a release, make sure the raw
packages are available in http://sirikata.com/releases/, run
create-release.sh to get things setup, then run InstallBuilder and
generate the installers. You should *not* use the sirikata.xml
file. The create-release.sh script generates a new copy,
sirikata-VERSION.xml for the given release. If it can be found, the
script will run InstallBuilder from the command line, completing the
process and leaving you with two installers.
