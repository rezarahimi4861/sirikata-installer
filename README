These is the installer configuration and scripts for Sirikata. See
Sirikata's home page at http://sirikata.com for details on the
project. Here we have the installer project for BitRock InstallBuilder
and some helper scripts.

Short version: run

./create-release.sh 1 5 8

for release v1.5.8 and upload the installers, the Mac update package,
and the update.xml to the server. Do the update.xml only after the
others finish and you verify them.

Details:

The sirikata.xml InstallBuilder project has the majority of the
configuration. To create installers for a release, make sure the raw
packages are available in http://sirikata.com/releases/, run
create-release.sh to get things setup, then run InstallBuilder and
generate the installers. You should *not* use the sirikata.xml
file. The create-release.sh script generates a new copy,
sirikata-VERSION.xml for the given release. If it can be found, the
script will run InstallBuilder from the command line, completing the
process and leaving you with two installers.

The sirikata-autoupdate.xml file controls the autoupdaters, which are
included in the installer. The update[-template].ini is deployed along with the
autoupdater and mostly just records the current version and points at
the update info. Importantly, the version_id in that file must be a
positive integer. In order to handle our version numbers properly, we
use 3 digits per version level (i.e. major, minor revision), so
0010020013 is version 1.2.13.
